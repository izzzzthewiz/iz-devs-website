            <h2><a href="https://www.izzdevs.me/scripts/xpuns" class="title">xPuns</a></h2>
            <p>Description: xPuns is a fully-Skripted punishment system with features including a punishment GUI, history GUI, alt-tracing, and more. This system is an improved and optimized version of a system that I released last year called SkPuns. I decided to make this system because I have received a lot of messages lately regarding SkPuns and I decided to make a new version of it from scratch to optimize its performance and improve its customization.</p>
