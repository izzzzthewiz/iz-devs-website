======================== INTRO ========================

This is the "readme" file for xPuns. All of the
information in this file is important to know and
should be read before using these scripts.

First of all, this set of scripts took a lot of time
and effort to make. For this reason, I have left a
donation link that appears in the message the console
gets when the config is loaded and in /xpuns info. You
can find that at https://paypal.me/IsaiahJW.

For fair use purposes, please do not edit or plagiarize
this script in any way, shape or form. Like I said,
I took the time to create these scripts and it would be
unfair and immoral to benefit from my work.


===================== DEPENDENCIES =====================

Skript - https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases
Skellett - https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skript-java-addon-skellett.34361/


====================== IMPORTANT ======================

The configuration file (xPuns-Config.sk) contains 3
options for the names of the 3 xPuns Skript files. Make
sure to change those options if you change the names of
the files.

Note: You must remove any join/quit messages from other
scripts to avoid double messages/spam from banned
players trying to join!
